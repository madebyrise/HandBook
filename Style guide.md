The Rise  Marketing Communications Style Guide sets standards for clarity and consistency
in all Rise sales and marketing communications. 

*1. Guidelines for Writers, Editors, and Reviewers‚Äù gives advice on format, writing editing*

Writing "Rise":

Rise should only ever be displayed in capital letters in the Rise wordmark, using the specific design guide for the Rise wordmark which is displayed in Babas Neue.

Otherwise, Rise should always be typed in standard title format, with the first letter capitalised.

Tools:

1. Email: Gmail and Grammarly 

2. Word documents and presentations: Google Docs and Google Slides


Fonts: 
---

Fonts: We use the Roboto family, including website: we use Arial size 11 to ensure consistency in handling by all recipient email handlers.

All other documents: We use Arial to ensure consistency in handling by all recipient email handlers.

Email font: We use Arial point 11 for all email text.

Email signature:
---

The Rise email signature is intentionally consistent across all employees. We don't use any styling above the standard Arial 11 point font. The reason for not having images, coloured links, coloured text and other styling attributes is due to the lack of control there is in the what the end user ultimately receives. Enterprise email systems can remove imnages and replace with ugly '.png' markers, some devices don't render colour as we would like them to appear or maybe expect them to appear on other screens, this is certainly the case when you move away from Apple Retina displays.
