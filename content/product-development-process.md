# Product Development Process

Inspired by Basecamp's Shape Up book: [https://basecamp.com/shapeup](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)

## Cycles

- Cycles run 5 weeks: 4 weeks development / 1 week cool-down
- Cycle should start with the team breaking down the pitch(s) and self assigning tasks
  - Developers should initally add `imagined` tasks
  - As work starts they add `discovered` tasks
  - Non-developers must not add development tasks in cycle
  
- Prioritising tasks in such a way to reduce blockage ðŸ˜±
- QA should happen in week 4 of the cycle
- Deployment should happen before cool-down
- Each cycle should be debriefed during cool-down
- The next cycle's pitch(s) should be bet on during cool-down
- Other time in cool-down is used at team members discretion for other tasks. e.g Dependency updates and bug regressions.

## Debrief

A debrief should cover these key points
- The cycle process as a whole (whats good/bad)
- The team structure, communication and working conditions

Structure of a debrief session:
- Before the session max 4 points from each team member for both positive and negative things for that cycle
- 1 hour timeboxed ðŸ˜± video/audio call to discuss points
- Agreed max 4 points things for improvement across the team
- Review and update this document where appropriate
