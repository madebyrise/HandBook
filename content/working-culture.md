## Remote working policy
* We work remotely across development and sales
* This is enabled firstly by excellent communication, disciplined use of our tools and trust in who we hire
* We have all-hands meets once per quarter
* Team members can join Eight in London or the equivalent in other cities for executive, partner or sales meetings
* Add a `location indicator` to your signature:

e.g.

Jacob Wilson
Business Support Manager @Rise
Manchester, United Kingdom


## 4 day week policy
* Full-time at Rise is a 4 day week, ideally whatever you do on your fifth working week day should be whatever improves your wellbeing
* We embrace part-time working and job shares, ideally as part-time 2 day per week roles

## Taking time out during the day to run errands, do exercise, take a nap or whatever.
A tricky element of remote and flexible working is when someone wants to take a long period out during the day. A longer lunch. A bike ride. Both.

Perhaps you started early. Maybe you've figured out how to balance your schedule in your own mind. How you communicate to others is important. That communication adds to setting the ongoing tone and trust of the company when it's online, which is most of the time. Online _is_ our working environment and culture.

On the one hand, it's important you know they can take that time out. It is also important that managers have a happy team without grudges. We all need confidence that the work will get done. That's a lot of stuff going on! And that needs figuring out and documenting. Getting it even _almost_ right is hard.

Flexible working has to be designed. Like anything else in life and software. So we start with the basics, how and where we communicate the most, and in our case, Slack.

# Communicating on Slack about taking time out of the normal working day
1. If you communicate on a team or public channel, be clear about why you are going - what justifies it. 

We're a wellbeing company and we practice what we preach. A bike ride or yoga class is something we want to encourage taking time out for but be clear about when you're getting back so we know when to expect you, and when we shouldn't be badgering you.

"I'm doing my thursday karate matt session at 2, I'll be back online at 2:30pm"

2. If it's not justifiable, and is more of a weekend or evening job, you'll know as you won't want to be transparent about it. Helping a mate design his latest band-room is largely not workable unless you take the time off in advance. Dropping it in on the day could lead to people thinking that it's ok to drop out of the office regularly and could quiclly descend into software culture anarchy ðŸ‘º
3. If it's sensitive, communicate it on private channels.
4. Plan and communicate in advance with the people who need to know.
5. Keep an eye on your own comms. Think about how others perceive you and how others are behaving on public channels.
6. Be open to feedback and open conversations.

# The principle of _'being here at the same-time, enables collaboration'_
The principle of "same-time" i.e.the hours where the team are working on something at the same time, is important. If you lose 2 hours 'same-time' every day, that's not good. 

An example of this might be one person working from 9-11 pm every day to make up a couple of hours lost between 9-11 am ... the more of this there is across employees, the harder it gets to manage.

Simply put, we try to get most of our time in work as 'same-time'.
