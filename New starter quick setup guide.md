Firstly you'll need to get setup on the tools we use. As a rmeote company we rely on these to work, and work effectively. 

We recommend that you download the desktop and mobile versions for Slack and Trello, as well as favouriting the URLs (below):

1. Slack - for all internal communications except email, and for shared channels for external partner communications, join at this workspace: https://risetoday.slack.com/
2. Gmail - for all internal and external company email. Request an account from James. https://gmail.com
3. Trello - for Active Development burndown, Product Roadmap, Sales and Marketing Operations, and Admin. Join the Trello team here: https://trello.com/invite/rise220/8d3b5d49e2b05e9bca6394a538259159
4. GitHub - for development repository and core and evolving documents, such as this handbook. Request access from Matt or James.
5. HubSpot - used as our CRM, and integrates with Gmail - so you'll need to make sure you use the Gmail client for mail, and not MacMail, Outlook or some other email client. Request access from Matt. https://app.hubspot.com/

We'll be adding guides on each tool and how we use them soon.
