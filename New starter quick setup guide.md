Firstly you'll need to get setup on the tools we use. As a rmeote company we rely on these to work, and work effectively. 

We recommend that you download the desktop and mobile versions for Slack and Trello, as well as favouriting the URLs (below):

1. Slack - for all internal communications except email, and for shared channels for external partner communications
2. Gmail - for all internal and external company email
3. Trello - for Active Development burndown, Product Roadmap, Sales and Marketing Operations, and Admin 
4. GitHub - for development repository and core and evolving documents, such as this handbook 
5. HubSpot - used as our CRM, and integrates with Gmail - so you'll need to make sure you use the Gmail client for mail, and not MacMail, Outlook or some other email client

We'll be adding guides on each tool and how we use them soon.
