#Core tools and systems
---

Firstly you'll need to get setup on the tools we use. As a largely remote company we rely on consistent and effective use of these.

We recommend that you download the desktop and mobile versions for Slack and Trello, as well as favouriting the URLs (below):

1. Slack
---
For all internal communications except email, and for shared channels for external partner communications, join at this workspace: https://risetoday.slack.com/

2. Gmail
---
For all internal and external company email. Request an account from James. https://gmail.com 
Due to the HubSpot integration for external communication tracking, standalone email handlers like Mac Mail or Outlook shouldn't be used.
N.B. HubSPot integration is used for storage of details of communications for data protection and retention purposes, as well as CRM purposes).

3. Trello
---
For Active Development burndown, Product Roadmap, Sales and Marketing Operations, and Admin. Join the Trello team here: https://trello.com/invite/rise220/8d3b5d49e2b05e9bca6394a538259159

4. GitHub
---
For development repository and core and evolving documents, such as this handbook. Request access from Matt or James.

5. HubSpot
---
The Rise CRM, and integrates with Gmail - so you'll need to make sure you use the Gmail client for mail, and not MacMail, Outlook or some other email client. Request access from Matt. https://app.hubspot.com/
