# Remote working policy
* We work remotely across development and sales
* This is enabled firstly by excellent communication, disciplined use of our tools and trust in who we hire
* We have all-hands meets once per quarter
* Team members can join Eight in London or the equivalent in other cities for executive, partner or sales meetings

# 4 day week policy
* Full-time at Rise is a 4 day week, ideally whatever you do on your fifth working week day should be whatever improves your wellbeing
* We embrace part-time working and job shares, ideally as part-time 2 day per week roles
